# Semi-Supervised Learning with Pseudo-Labeling

This repository contains the code, tutorial, and resources for implementing a **Semi-Supervised Learning** approach using **Pseudo-Labeling** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset in PyTorch.

## 📌 Project Overview

In many real-world scenarios, labeled data is scarce while unlabeled data is abundant. This project demonstrates how to leverage both using a simple yet powerful method — **pseudo-labeling**.

We simulate a semi-supervised environment:
- Use only 1,000 labeled CIFAR-10 images (100 per class)
- Treat the remaining 49,000 images as unlabeled
- Train a baseline CNN model
- Generate pseudo-labels with high-confidence predictions
- Retrain with combined labeled + pseudo-labeled data

## 🙋‍♂️ Personal Reflection

Creating this project helped me move beyond the theory of semi-supervised learning into hands-on practice.
Implementing pseudo-labeling taught me how models can learn effectively from confident predictions on unlabeled data.
I also learned the importance of thresholding, balanced datasets, and careful combination of data sources.
Debugging the training loop and fixing type errors was challenging but rewarding. I now feel better prepared
to apply SSL methods in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce.
